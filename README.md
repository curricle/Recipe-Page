## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I learned that you can customize list markers, which is not something I knew how to do prior to this project.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Guide by CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Useful resource for brushing up on the basics of CSS grid layouts.
- [::marker Pseudoelement Documentation by Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) - This helped me style the the list markers.
